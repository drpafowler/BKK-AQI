# Project Title
## My package
This is a project to create an app that does stuff.  The stuff that it does is to access an air quality API periodically.  When the airquality is bad, e.g. in the unhealthy range, it sends an alert to the user.  The user can then take action to protect their health.  It also sends an air quality forecast for the day at 6AM.
